    <h3 class="plan-section-header">Strategy</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-grid">
    <p>Try to finish each day <b>within 10g</b> of each of your macro goals every day. This will ensure you're in
        a calorie deficit while still getting enough protein to keep or build muscle and fuel your workouts.</p>
    <p>Most of your fat burn will come from diet, but the workout plan is still important. Doing these workouts
        will keep your TDEE high and promote a lean, healthy body.
    </p>
    <p>As a beginner, <b>focus on form</b> and learning the movement. If you aren't sure about an exercise in your plan,
        ask a gym instructor or use YouTube to learn how to do it properly. Start at a very comfortable weight to
        start, and as the weeks progress try to <b>move the weight up each session</b>. Track your sessions so you know what you
        lifted last time. As things get heavier, start towards the lower end of the rep range and move up from there.
        Make sure to warm up with light weights at the beginning of each session.
    </p>
    <p><b>Track your weight</b> throughout the weeks. If your weight loss stalls or you gain weight on your macros, slowly take away
        carbohydrates 20g a week until you lose weight again. You can also introduce cardio later on in order to help burn more
        fat. A good starting point is 200kcal of cardio twice a week. Build this up over time just you like you do with your weights.
    </p>
    <p>Don't give up! Aim to lose <b>1%</b> of your overall body weight each week. Do this for a few months and you can see huge changes.</p>
