    <h3 class="plan-section-header">Strategy</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-grid">
    <p>Try to finish each day <b>within 5g</b> of each of your macro goals every day. This will ensure you're in a
        calorie surplus and have enough energy to build muscle and progress in the gym, but only a small one to limit
        fat gain. Use protein shakes if you struggle to eat enough protein/get enough calories.
    </p>
    <p>To build muscle effectively, you will need to have adequate recovery as well as nutrition and training. Make sure
        you get the recommended <b>8 hours</b> of sleep a night. You are going to be training hard, so this is
        important.
    </p>
    <p>Building muscle is all about <b>time under tension.</b> Focus on form and control each rep. In the eccentric
        phase (lifting the weight back to its starting position), take about 2 seconds after each rep to control the
        weight back down. This will increase your time under tension and promote muscle growth, whilst also encouraging
        good form. As the weeks progress try to <b>move the weight up
            each session</b>. Track your sessions so you know
        what you lifted last time. As things get heavier, start towards the lower end of the rep range and move up from
        there. Make sure to warm up with light weights at the beginning of each session. You're an intermediate lifter
        and you know what hard work feels like. <b>Make sure you're working hard</b> each and every session.
    </p>
    <p><b>Track your weight</b> throughout the weeks. If your weight remains the same or even drops, up your calories
        slowly by adding 20g of carbs each week until you start to gain weight at a slow rate.
    </p>
    <p>Be patient. Building muscle takes a long time and a lot of consistency. You have already built a solid foundation
        of muscle and progress will be slower for you, but it will still be there. Look at progress in terms of months
        not
        weeks, and enjoy the
        gradual changes you make to your body.</p>
