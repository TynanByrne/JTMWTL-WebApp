    <h3 class="plan-section-header">Strategy</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-grid">
    <p>Try to finish each day <b>within 10g</b> of each of your macro goals every day. This will ensure you're in a
        calorie surplus and have enough energy to build muscle and progress in the gym, but only a small one to limit
        fat gain. Use protein shakes if you struggle to eat enough protein/get enough calories.
    </p>
    <p>To build muscle effectively, you will need to have adequate recovery as well as nutrition and training. Make sure
        you get the recommended <b>8 hours</b> of sleep a night.
    </p>
    <p>As a beginner, <b>focus on form</b> and learning the movement. If you aren't sure about an exercise in your plan,
        ask a gym instructor or use YouTube to learn how to do it properly. Start at a very comfortable weight to
        start, and as the weeks progress try to <b>move the weight up each session</b>. Track your sessions so you know
        what you lifted last time. As things get heavier, start towards the lower end of the rep range and move up from
        there.
        Make sure to warm up with light weights at the beginning of each session.
    </p>
    <p><b>Track your weight</b> throughout the weeks. If your weight remains the same or even drops, up your calories
        slowly by adding 20g of carbs each week until you start to gain weight at a slow rate.
    </p>
    <p>Be patient. Building muscle takes a long time. Look at progress in terms of months not weeks, and enjoy the
        gradual changes you make to your body.</p>
